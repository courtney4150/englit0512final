                            In “Corporate Ideology and World of Warcraft”, Scott Rettburg discusses the importance of the in-game economy to the function of the game. He talks about how the social aspect of seeing other players level up and flying by on creatures made him question his own ability to save his money for such investments. Despite this being part of what some might consider a utopia, the capitalist structure reminds us of the real world. Those who have wealth have access to better resources and therefore might have a better game experience. The idea of not wasting time, or the protestant work ethic, is incorporated into the game as well. Rettburg describes how accomplishing quests and tasks might feel boring and repetitive, but many players enjoy those actions because it feels like they are accomplishing work and therefore not wasting time. He says “when play feels like labor, … play does not feel like a waste of time” (page 32). It is fascinating to see how precisely the things that we might not enjoy in the real world (tedious work) become the things players want to do in a virtual world.

                            (Taken from my submission for Discussion Post 3). In “What Makes World of Warcraft a World? A Note on Death and Dying,” Lisbeth Klastrup examines the implementation and implications of death in the game World of Warcraft. My experience leads me to agree with the author’s analysis of death in World of Warcraft. In general, I quickly found that it was very frustrating to die. Character death in World of Warcraft causes, in some way, a sense of loss of progress. In my experience, death cost me time because I would have to retrace my steps. Since I was playing World of Warcraft with the goal of leveling up, I disliked what felt like wasting time that I could spend gaining experience points.

                        <p>
                            One of the first ways Klastrup analyzes death in World of Warcraft is through a player’s first time experiencing a character's death. I agree with the conclusions about a character’s first time dying and what that experience was like. The aesthetics of the game at this point and the sense of a rite of passage contribute to the player’s experience of dying for the first time. The first time dying is remarkable partially because the aesthetics are noticeably different. The author states that the aesthetics “left me with no doubt that I was dead” (page 149). This was true in my experience as well: everything from the grayscale world to the inability to interact with the world convinced me that I was certainly in a different mode of play. I even noticed that the ghost character interacted with the terrain differently: where a normal character would get stuck on rocks or swim in water, the ghost seemed unaffected by the terrain and floated easily. In addition, the author discusses how dying in World of Warcraft can be considered a rite of passage for each player. I agree with this viewpoint and I also experienced this. I had read this piece before playing much of the game, so this reading somewhat helped shape my expectations for the in-game death experience. Regardless, the first time my character died, I was still unsure of what to expect and therefore was nervous about the process. In subsequent deaths, I began to feel more and more as though it was just an inconvenience and I just had to go to the motions to pick up where I left off.
